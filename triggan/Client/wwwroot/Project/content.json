Well do both obviously!  \nThat\u0027s how **Little Chef Logan** was born: I wanted to enjoy spending time with him and take time to cook. I wanted to share some stuff I can do with my 2 years old son at cooking!",

Some of the remaining recipes should be done sometime else (red fruits or tomato in winter? Nope).\n\nFrom these filmed cooking sessions, I\u0027ve struggled to get a good result. But I also thought that if I keep delaying the video editing part, the publish part, I wouldn\u0027t do it at all. So after a few hours of reviewing, I decided upon a recipe (which one? surprise) and though it\u0027s far from perfect, I\u0027ll edit what I have before trying to film something else.\n\n\nSee you soon for more food!",
