But what I think is one of the best: *familly time*.  \nThat should definitively \u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E stop you from doing something else also.\n\nAs I *love* my son, and as I love cooking, what should I do? Well do both obviously!  \nThat\u0027s how **Cooking With Logan** was born: I wanted to enjoy spending time with him and take time to cook. I wanted to share some stuff I can do with my 2 years old son at cooking.!",

Some of the remaining recipes should be done sometime else (red fruits or tomato in winter? Nope).\n\nFrom these filmed cooking sessions, I\u0027ve struggled to get a good result. But I also thought that if I keep delaying the video editing part, the publish part, I wouldn\u0027t do it at all. So after a few hours of reviewing, I decided upon a recipe (which one? surprise) and though it\u0027s far from perfect, I\u0027ll edit what I have before trying to film something else.\n\n\nSee you soon for more food!",

I wasn\u0027t able to publish anything usable! Getting from unusable feature such as Azure Functions, a DAL which wouldn\u0027t run on various host (allowing only previous .NET versions) or some very expensives ideas (Azure Functions cumulate almost all the issues).\n\nBut in the end I found it! I found a way to make it work. The actuall website [triggan.com](https://www.triggan.com) is a static blazor website, using two json files as \u0022database\u0022.\n\nWhen I want to update stuff, I run the server version locally (which I should fully deploy to avoid the need to run VS each time). The server app possess git feature. When I save stuff, it commits and push to a publication branch, which triggers github actions and TADA!\n\nThis update is actually the final test...\n\n_Hourray!_",
