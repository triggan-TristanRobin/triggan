    "Content": "I\u0027ve recently been hearing Tim Ferriss talking a few times about how he went from focusing on time management to energy management last year.\n\nI must admit that this resonated quite a lot in my head. My son has *so much* more energy than my wife and I do. And these days I cannot seem to handle any type of schedule outside of work meetings.\n\n\nBut then there is the energy. When your time is limited (it always is), you need to use it wisely.\nThen why are you watching that Netflix show you don\u0027t like that much when you could start writing on the book you have been thinking about for so long?\nWhy are you eating that bag of chips when you could easily cook some delicious healthy meal for the week?\n\nMaybe you will tell yourself and others you don\u0027t have the motivation to do so. but we all know that motivation isn\u0027t reliable. If you want to stick to your plans, you need the energy to fight your inner lazy self. So think just a little bit about how to have more energy.\n\nAfter that, get to work and show us what you can do!",

    "Content": "There are lots of people who said it before me: motivation is a lie. You cannot be motivated all the time, it is not reliable. What it means is you need to create systems and habits that will make you keep working on what matters to you, no matter what.\n\nYou can however have various level of motivation. We are not talking about the feeling only here. Maybe you are lost. You have been driving a lot in so many directions, but now you don\u0027t know anymore.\n\nWhere are you going? Where is going that big project of yours?\n\nIt\u0027s pretty hard to find any actually working systems to help you work in this case because you are starting to doubt the core goals of what you do. And it can be very impacting on your mood and most probably other parts of your life if you are lost.\n\nSo what to do? Let\u0027s get inspired by Tony Robbins. There is a part in is book \u0022Awaken the Giant Within\u0022 discussing the need to be able to switch your state. For example, when I walk my dog, I usually get my inner peace back pretty much instantly.\nBut if you don\u0027t know where you go, changing your emotional state won\u0027t necessarily make you the driver of your life again.\n\nThen use it just like the motivation: at a higher level. Maybe you need to spend a week at your family\u0027s house. Maybe you would change your mind after a few days alone in the mountains to reflect on your life. Even a adrenaline-fuled activity like parchute jumping or a flight in a fighter aircraft can totally change your situation by being so much more than your usal emotion changers.\n\nWhat you just need to think about is what will work for you. I avoided reading some self development and productivity books recently because I was thinking it wouldn\u0027t be useful right now, until I know again where I go.\nUntil recently when I noticed that reading The 4 Hour Work week is EXACTLY how I can know where I go.\n\nNow, let\u0027s drive again, we\u0027ve got a long road to do.",
