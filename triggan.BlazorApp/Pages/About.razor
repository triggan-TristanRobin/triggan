    <h3>An IT Consulting Company</h3>
    <p>
        The first reason triggan exists is to be my IT consulting company. I can help you with your IT project, join your team, create a POC or a MVP, let's discuss to see if I can help you! <br />
        If you want to learn more, check my <a href="/work">work together page</a> or <a href="#contact">contact me</a>.

    <h3>A blog following my journey as a dad</h3>
    <p>
        I love building stuff, learning new skills and play and so does my son!<br/>
        Doing both at the same time is not always easy, and I want to share my experience here.<br />
        So if you want to read about anything related to raising kids, learning, building, ..., check the <a href="/blog">blog</a> and let me know your thoughts!
    </p>

    <h3>A place to share projects</h3>
    <p>
        triggan is the home of my projects. They might be business oriented, just for fun, some tools I build for myself, ... <br />
        You can take a look at them and their progress <a href="/projects">here</a>.<br />
        I you have an idea of yourself you'd like to discuss, <a href="#contact">send a message</a>! I would love to talk about it.
    </p>

    <h3>A sandbox to test new stuff</h3>
    <p>
        Even if they are mostly hidden for my own use, you might find some useless stuff on this site. <br />
        This website is indeed home to many test I want to make, either to learn, to verify technology, or anything else! <br />
        Did you notice some strange features? Reach out to me!
