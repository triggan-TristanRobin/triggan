<h1>The books I've read</h1>
<p>
    Books are powerful. I wanted to start sharing my thoughts on the books I've read here but it will take time, come back often to check the list!

@if (books?.Any() != true)
{
    <p><em>Loading books...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <div class="content-list">
        @foreach (var book in books)
        {
            <BookSummary Book=@book />
        }
    </div>
}

@code {
    private List<Book> books = new();

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        await Task.Delay(100);

It's not the books I've most acted upon but it changed my vision on life entirely (even though it took time).\r\nTim Ferriss has a fun writing in my opinion, but mostly wrote a very clear step by step guide into a new way of living your life.",

Derek Sivers, as most often, only relates his story, without ever saying what you hsould or shouldn't do.\r\nThe book is short, funny and to the point.\r\nIt provides a different way of viewing how business are built and run.\r\nWhat you will learn and retain from this book is entirely dependant on yourself.",
